        Hello folks, <br>
        This is an spotify's clone website Unlikely spotify, there only 5 songs  which you can play. You can go to the next song by clicking forward and navigate back by clicking on backward button. You can play or pause any song by clicking on play/pause button. You can seek in the song in the song at whichever time you want by double clicking on seekbar. <br>
        <h2>FUTURE ENHACEMENTS</h2><br>
        <p> This is the most basic form of spotify made only using frontend and a little bit of javascript. In future i would like to modify it by backend and also providing features like searchbar and random and download button. Also i would like to include some features like artist based or genre based playlists.</p> <br>
